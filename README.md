### Key Business & Analytical Insights. 

Daily average house prie shows visible volatility through May 2014, ranging between $400k to over $600k. 

The most common home configuration was 3 and 2-2.5 bathrooms, which indicate stamdard family-sized homes were in highest demand. 

House with 4+ Bedrooms were less frequent implying small luxury market share or more selective buyers. 

The map shows geographical concentration of sales and pricing intensity in Seattle, Bellevue and Tacoma Regions. 

Areas with brighter color tones on the map suggest higher transaction volumes or prices, enabling zoning-level demand mapping for realtors or investors.

Homes with excellent condition and view averaged over $1.1M, which was signicantly higher than homes with no view. 


This project demonstrates my ability to build end-to-end dashboards, extract business insights and apply business logic to data.
